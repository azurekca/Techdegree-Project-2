# Techdegree-Project-2
 Pagination project for the Treehouse FSJS Techdegree program

This project demonstrates unobtrusive JavaScript to display a long list of student names seperated into discrete pages. The user can access all the students by using the links provided at the bottom of the page.

This project relies on DOM manipulation and list iteration to parse the HTML data and provide functionality. Without JavaScript enabled, the entire list of students is displayed at once.

A search box is also provided to facilitate searching for students by name with a full or partial match.
